# Classification Algorithms: Louvain vs. K-Means

## Overview
This repository explores the application of classification algorithms, specifically the Louvain method and K-Means clustering, on Facebook datasets. By employing these algorithms, we aim to understand and compare their effectiveness in identifying community structures within social networks. Additionally, the repository provides insights into identifying influential nodes within these communities.

## Dataset
The Facebook datasets used in this project contain anonymized social network data, capturing connections between users, group memberships, and other relevant attributes. The datasets serve as the basis for our analysis and classification experiments.

## Algorithms
### 1. Louvain Method
The Louvain method is a popular community detection algorithm that optimizes modularity to identify clusters within networks. It iteratively optimizes the partitioning of nodes to maximize the modularity score, resulting in cohesive community structures.

### 2. K-Means Clustering
K-Means clustering is a well-known unsupervised learning algorithm used for partitioning data into distinct clusters. In the context of social network analysis, K-Means can be applied to group nodes based on similarity in their connectivity patterns.

## Results
The results of our classification experiments showcase the effectiveness of both the Louvain method and K-Means clustering in identifying community structures within the Facebook datasets. Additionally, we highlight the identification of influential nodes within these communities, providing valuable insights into network dynamics and connectivity patterns.

## Usage
To replicate our experiments and analyze the classification results, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., Python, networkx).
3. Run the provided scripts or notebooks to execute the classification algorithms on the Facebook datasets.
4. Explore the results and visualize the identified communities and influential nodes.
